Most people initially struggled with communication over digital media. Though video calls and virtual team meetings did offer some support, it was not the same as in-person interactions.According to the Remote Work Report published by Nira, communication was cited as the number one challenge of remote working, followed by opportunities for socializing. The biggest challenge with remote team productivity, however, has probably been team collaboration. While in the office you could walk over to a colleague's desk for a quick chat or have an intense brainstorming session in the boardroom, in remote work none of this is possible.The real issue was a lack of tools and platforms that could help remote workforces collaborate seamlessly.This is particularly true for areas where collaboration is key, such as content marketing. Content teams require inputs from many stakeholders, be it internally (sales teams, product teams, etc.) or externally (clients, freelancers, etc.).",

Most people initially struggled with communication over digital media. Though video calls and virtual team meetings did offer some support, it was not the same as in-person interactions.According to the Remote Work Report published by Nira, communication was cited as the number one challenge of remote working, followed by opportunities for socializing. The biggest challenge with remote team productivity, however, has probably been team collaboration. While in the office you could walk over to a colleague's desk for a quick chat or have an intense brainstorming session in the boardroom, in remote work none of this is possible.The real issue was a lack of tools and platforms that could help remote workforces collaborate seamlessly.This is particularly true for areas where collaboration is key, such as content marketing. Content teams require inputs from many stakeholders, be it internally (sales teams, product teams, etc.) or externally (clients, freelancers, etc.).",
